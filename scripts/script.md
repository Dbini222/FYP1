This directory is to store all the scripts that I will be using in this project. This is limited to MEN'S T-SHIRTS

AIM:
- go through the several e-commerce website pages get images from their best selling t-shirts
- if they don't have a best selling t-shirt area, think of other alternatives such as filtering by popularity etc
- 

The websites which I am going to use for webscraping are:
- Tee Fury
- Underground Printing
- Elevated Faith
- Redbubble
- Spreadshirt
- Aasaan App
- Shopify
- Aliexpress: https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-men-t-shirts.html?g=y&SearchText=men+t+shirts&sortType=total_tranpro_desc
- Amazon (top 100 t-shirts): https://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Sellers-Fashion-Mens-T-Shirts/zgbs/fashion/1731028031/ref=zg_bs_nav_fashion_4_1731025031

AMAZON:

They have the top best 100 male t-shirts in the link below. The website also shows the following measures:
-Rating
-How many people rated the t-shirt.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Sellers-Fashion-Mens-T-Shirts/zgbs/fashion/1731028031/ref=zg_bs_nav_fashion_4_1731025031

ALIEXPRESS:

They allow you to order the t-shirt based on how many orders it has, so the link below is ordered based on high orders first
