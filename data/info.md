Most of the data in this directory should have the following form

Perhaps the only different one might be Aliexpress with it's multiple images but we will see if that is the case

All data should be in order of best selling for their respective website, with the first entries being the highest sold

Side note:
Some of the images appear in multiple websites such as Redbubble and Society6. This may mean that entries are duplicated which is not what we want, however if something is in the top best selling on multiple websites, think about how you would want to deal with that. Surely you would want to give extra rewards. you can now find duplicates due to shop name
